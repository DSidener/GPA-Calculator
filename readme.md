## Static Code Analysis Policy

Before any major production release, this project applies static code analysis using [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) to detect potential issues in the source code.

Cppcheck is a free and open-source tool that analyzes C++ code for bugs, undefined behavior, memory leaks, and other defects beyond what typical compiler warnings provide.

All critical issues reported by cppcheck must be reviewed and addressed before a production release.
